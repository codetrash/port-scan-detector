Environment and Dependencies

This program was build on 64 bit linux, g++ (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.3-1ubuntu1) 4.7.3
Install pcap library before running.


To the code - 

1) Make run.sh executable
2) Run 'run.sh' - It will run make and then start the program with sudo privledges.

Execution - 

1) It prints a possible scan as soon as it detects it
2) To stop, press 'CTRL+C', it will print statistics of each host seen on the network and then it will quit.



Peculiarities - 

1) While Syn scanning only one SYNACK and one RST is noticed from mutiple closed ports.	
2) Ideally there should be one RST sent back from each of the 999 closed ports on my host
3)Sometimes while running nmap and the port scanner on the same host, some FIN packets are not captured.
